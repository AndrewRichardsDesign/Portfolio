<h1>
  What To Do With Long Lists of Products?
</h1>

<h2>
USAA - AppX
</h2>

<p>
    With the original business requirement of giving members equal access to all content on Home, we tried a few approaches to create a simplified first level. Our designs ranged from showing a selection of accounts on the first level and everything else on a deeper page, expanding cards to view all, and controversially, just showing everything exposed by default on the first level of Home.
</p>

<p>
  Member feedback showed that they want to see all of their products in one place. Additionally, business concerns were overcome with the reasoning that the vast majority of members have few accounts, which will not push marketing and other lines of business out of sight. Members with many accounts already have deep relationships with USAA and is a less critical target audience for further deepening.

<h1>
Example
</h1>

<p>
The difference between these two screens is the number of accounts, groups, and totals in the Banking card. With the rules we decided on, all of this information is shown by default. There is no second level or expand/collapse. The vast majority of members have very few accounts, but for those who own five and more products, they will be able to see everything on this first page.
