<h1>
    A much needed redesign
</h1>

<p>
    Besides minor updates, the app has not been redesigned since about 2007. It was not meeting member needs, yet its utilization was on the rise, quickly overtaking the website.
</p>

<p>
    The app was slow in terms of navigation and performance. It didn’t allow members to view the information they needed most and navigation was confusing.

<h1>
    What we did...and are still doing
</h1>

<p>
    My team and I drastically simplified the UX, making the app and website familiar experiences. We aligned the taxonomy, structure, and concepts across platforms, defined the app’s overall interaction model, then fleshed out two heavily trafficked parts of the app, the public and private homepage experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our efforts helped determine how USAA embraces platform conventions while digitally expressing its brand and influenced our new native design language system.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    This was also a challenge in communication and collaboration. I learned how to better navigate a space with multiple design teams involved, conflicting viewpoints from business and development, and direct executive involvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below, I shared parts of the project that I personally worked on, either individually or collaboratively.

<h1>
    How was the app struggling?
</h1>

<p>
    Years of data and member feedback brought to light many problems with the design. 
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The old app’s interface contained irrelevant content to members, distracting them from what they were there to do. 
    </li>

    <li>
      Members struggled with basic navigation which increased volume to call centers, often an avoidable cost for the company. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Data and the company’s understanding of individual members was being severely underutilized, as product advertisements and advice were often irrelevant and thus, ignored.
    </li>

    <li>
      The basic structure of the app was not meeting the core need of quickly accessing accounts and policies. Members wanted to see everything they owned at the top level.

    <li>
      The rate of product acquisition in native was not keeping up with the shift to this platform. 
    </li>
  </ul>

<h1>
    Organization and Interaction
</h1>

<p>
    In an effort to drive alignment across platforms and simplify the UX, we incorporated concepts and structures that we had previously developed for the redesign of our website’s private homepage. We tackled challenges like how members...
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We arrived at a tab bar organization divided into three spaces of ‘Home’, ‘Search’, and ‘Chat’.

  </p>

  <p>
    Home, being our focus, contains a mix of cards that organize members’ products, provide entry points to common actions and new product acquisition, deliver personalized ads, and helpful content or reminders like upcoming bills and travel notices. 

  </p>
  
  <p>
    All of the content on Home is automatically prioritized based on the member’s activity and product relationship with USAA.

<h1>
    Equal Access vs Prioritizing Member’s Products

</h1>

<p>
    USAA members have a wide variety of relationships with the company and unique ways of organizing their stuff, which can create complexity in the UI. Currently, members have anywhere between 0 and nearly 100 bank accounts, insurance policies, and aggregated investments. On top of this, members might hide accounts, create groups, or see asset and liability totals depending on their product mix.
</p>

  <p>
    In the end, data and technical constraints pushed us to show everything on the first level of Home. Member feedback showed that members want to see all of their products in one place. Additionally, business concerns were overcome with the reasoning that the vast majority of members have few accounts, which will not push marketing and other lines of business out of sight. Members with many accounts already have deep relationships with USAA and is a less critical target audience for further deepening.

        <li>
          interaction analysis for migrating functionality from Home (view all, show hidden)

        </li>

        <li>
          reordering accounts or policies

        <li>
