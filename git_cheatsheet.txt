git cheat sheet
	


git status
	-check the current status of file heirarchy
git add .

git commit -m "commit message"

git push (if on that branch you wanna push to)

git pull
	-pulls changes from a current branch

git fetch --all
	-grab all the new changes/branches

git branch <NEW BRANCH NAME>
	-create a new branch with this name

git checkout <BRANCH NAME>
	-change your working branch to this one






If I commit a large file but it doesn't commit, then delete it and try to commit/push again git will still try to push that deleted file. You need to reset it...

(Find out how far ahead you are of the remote:)
'git status'


(It will tell you how many commits you are ahead. If it is 3 commits, do this:)
'git reset --soft HEAD~3' (Replace 3 with however many commits you are ahead.)


(Be careful not to mess up this command and do a hard reset, or you will lose your work. It needs to be a soft reset, which resets your git status but leaves your disk untouchedâ€¦)


(Then re-add everything:)
git add -A


(And recommit:)
git commit -m "Squashed commit"


(Push.)
'git push'

It should be as though the file was never committed.











git commit -am "<INSERT MESSAGE HERE>" (is this actually git commit -a)
	-creates a payload or commit with the specified message

git push origin HEAD
	-pushes to the current branch





ls --- show list of folder
rm -rf (name of folder)  --- this deletes the targeted folder
