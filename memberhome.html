Member Home
</h1>

<h2>
USAA
</h2>

<p>
The responsive private homepage for USAA.com, regularly serving 13 millions users. This space brings together a complex set of experiences and systems.
</p>

<p>
Member Home is the first page USAA members see after logging in. It’s where members can access and organize their accounts and policies, initiate common actions, like transferring funds, and keep track of ongoing activity, like an insurance claim. It’s a complex space of intersecting systems and information.

<h1>
History
</h1>

<p>
This project started in response to years of negative member feedback on the previous private homepage. It had been 10 years since the page was touched and a redesign was long overdue. There were many problem areas to address including…
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Difficult navigation
</li>

<li>
Cluttering with irrelevant information and marketing 
</li>

<li>
Low engagement with content
</li>

<li>
Not responsive

<li>
Slow in terms of technical performance
</li>
</ul>

<h1>
Our Goals
</h1>

<p>
We started by developing an understanding of what the space needed to do, digging into member feedback and understanding stakeholder issues and goals. Initial research and analysis informed our foundational goals for the experience. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Simplify with purpose
</li>

<li>
Personalize the experience
</li>

<li>
Be helpful and proactive

<h1>
How Did These Goals Take Form?
</h1>

<p>
We can see our goals come to life through the structure, visual design, and offerings of the page. 
</p>

<p>
The structure is composed of two high level sections, products (left column) and activity (right column). This simple division sets clear expectations for where to find information, drastically improving navigation. You’ll see how features within each section embody the goals mentioned above.
</p>

<p>
The visual design takes a minimalist approach, bringing the most important data to the forefront and allowing members to focus on the task at hand without the distractions of irrelevant promotions and overbearing branding. With our design language system in the midst of a redesign, our project positioned us to contribute significantly to the system and develop custom components in many cases.
</p>

<p>
Arguably the most important process, what the page offers was critically analyzed. Assessing and filtering which elements deserved to live on the page immediately created a simpler experience and establishing strict standards for future content add requests allows us to preserve simplicity and focus over time.

    Members are able to view their accounts and policies in either grid or list view. These options target member segments looking for a more modern, simple presentation and those looking for a traditional tally view that provides asset and liability totals.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Offering two views meant our concepts had to be tailored to each presentation. We created unique versions of marketing and contextual messages that are appended to accounts.
  </p>

  <p>
    The individual ‘account/policy item’ that comprises grid view was especially challenging to design. We went through many iterations, emphasizing the most sought after data while balancing visual hierarchy and complexity especially with higher numbers of accounts and policies.

      Contextual Servicing Actions
    </h1>
    
    <h2>
    Products Section
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Servicing actions, like transfer and pay bills, appear in the appropriate high level category (ie. Banking) when corresponding accounts or policies are present. For example ‘pay bills’ would not appear if a member only had a savings account in the Banking section because savings accounts don’t generate bills.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Each high level category can show up to 3 servicing actions and those buttons navigate to an experience owned by other teams. Banking might include Transfer and Pay Bills, Insurance might include Auto Proof and Claims, Investments might include Auto Invest and Buy/Sell.

    </p>

    <p>
      While we utilized existing icons for most of the servicing actions, I had the chance to create three custom icons for the following servicing actions: Buy/Sell, Insurance Bill, and Auto Invest. The style of these icons aligned to the existing icon library and were ultimately used on our page and elsewhere in the app and website.

        A rethink of how members browse product categories to see what USAA has to offer.
        </p>


        <p>
        Utilizing the same treatment as contextual servicing actions, product acquisition was also designed to be contextual, replacing the mega menu in the top navigation bar. Derived from IA testing, this effort streamlined the product search process while reinforcing our categories as distinct self-sufficient spaces.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Each entry point utilizes popover menus focused on a particular product category (ie. Banking) and ultimately links members to product pages. If a product has related services, like tenant screening for property insurance, those services appear in the acquisition menus.

        </h2>
        
        <p>
          The last major piece of the products section puzzle is how marketing fits in. Combining our goals of simplicity and personalization, we designed marketing to be as unobtrusive as possible while meeting, and ideally exceeding, product acquisition goals. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Our theory was that fewer but more relevant marketing would create perceived importance, reduce banner blindness and increase click-through rate, and product acquisition. We wanted members to know that this was truly their space and for marketing to feel helpful and relevant rather than intrusive, obnoxious.
        </p>

        <p>
          The visual design of marketing, being a variant of the product component, aimed to make marketing look like it could easily become a product.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rolling out to about half the membership by early 2021, about 6 million people, we saw a 4.3x increase in marketing click through and a 2.4x increase in quote starts.

          <p>
            Revisiting the accounts and policies that appear in this section, another capability of the space is aggregation of external accounts and policies. If a USAA member has a Chase savings account, they’re able to see the balance and transactions on USAA.com.

          </p>

          <p>
            USAA uses a 3rd party called MX to pull data from outside institutions to our databases and as a result, we inherited less than ideal solutions for error state, sign in, and data load messages and treatments.

          </p>

          <p>
          Our redesign tackles the experiences of various error states and reauthenticating by using specific language, setting clear expectations, and providing steps for resolution. We took the existing 15 errors and scenarios, organized them into nine logical groups and created unique messages and treatments for each group. Now, rather than members reading a single generic message, they understand exactly what is happening and how to fix it.

          </p>

          <p>
            Our solution utilized the messaging framework that my team created, which allows messages to be appended to accounts. It also leveraged the flexibility of our product components, which enables us to display data and statuses related to a particular product.

            <p>
              The activity feed (right column) is designed to provide information and allow members to take actions related to their relationship with USAA. It’s powered by a prioritization algorithm that ranks cards, considering the member’s utilization, product line up, and events like tax season.
            </p>
        
            <p>
              The activity feed contains bill reminders and shortcuts to pay them, recent transactions across all accounts, credit score, a tax reminder during tax season, and much more. It’s a framework that allows any product team at USAA to surface relevant content for members.

            </p>

            <p>
              Two examples I designed are the active claims and real estate reward cards. The claims card provides statuses at each step in the process, an entry point to the claims center, and a message counter from the member’s ongoing conversation with claims adjusters. The real estate rewards network card was intended to walk members through the process of buying and selling a house and ultimately receiving a monetary reward from USAA, but budget constraints simplified the solution to a simple list of properties and a corresponding reward status (pending or sent).

                The existing page had customization functionality but it was extremely confusing to use. The capabilities made sense and rooted in user needs, but interactions were poorly designed. Our job was to redesign the interactions for these existing features and look for additional opportunities.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                Integrating customize features into our new page, we designed entry and exit points, transition, base page, drag and drop interaction for reordering items, lightweight popover for renaming and hiding, interactions for creating, adding to, and deleting groups, and a way to switch between grid and list view. Outside of this mode, we created a way for members to temporarily see accounts or policies they previously hid and didn’t want visible by default.
